# Java-algorithms
Divide &amp; conquer, greedy and dynamic programming algorithms on java.
Greedy section covers canonical algorithms: knapsack, segments covering, huffman encoding/decoding, priority queue realization etc.  
Divide &amp; conquer section covers binary search, inversion count (based on merge sort), segments covering points count (based on quick/hoar sort), count/radix sort, heap sort etc.
Dynamic programming section is represented by solutions of classical tasks: knapsack, LCMS, editing distance (Levenshtein distance), staircase, min change, calculator, max independent set, matrix multiplication etc.
